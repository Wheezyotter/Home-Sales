# Home-Sales
Home-Sales is an exercise to practice using `SparkSQL` and `PySpark` with 'big data' and to gain skills with data storage such as using parquets and partioning and caching data.

Housing data is imported and then queried to answer four questions:

* What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?

* What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?

* What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?

* What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000?

The run time for the last query is compared using different storage techniques.

All queries done in `Home_Sales.ipynb`

Parquets stored in `home_sales` folder.
